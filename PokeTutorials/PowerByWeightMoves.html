      <h1>Power-By-Weight Moves</h1>
      <p>
        This is based on part 120 of Game Dev Experiments YouTube-series “Make a game like Pokémon in Unity series”. <br /><br />
        The affected scripts will be: <br />
        <ul>
          <li>PokemonBase.cs</li>
          <li>MovesBase.cs</li>
          <li>Pokemon.cs</li>
        </ul>
        Besides that we will create the move “Low Kick” And "Heavy Slam".
      </p>

      <p>
        In most cases Weight and Height are primairly simple fun facts. They don't anything gameplay wise to your playthrough; It's simply funny to know your wailord is gigantic!. 
        Well... today we are looking at 4 of the only exceptions. According to <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Weight">Bulbapedia</a> there are 4 Moves that change Power based on the weight.
        These 4 (using 2 different sets of ranges) are: Low Kick, Grass Knot, Heat Crash and Heavy Slam. \n\n <i>Note: There is a 5th move using weight (Sky Drop) which fails if a Pokémon is too heavy. This move won't be covered here </i>

      <h2 id="PokemonBase">PokemonBase.cs</h2>
      <p>
        First thing we are gonna add in this tutorial is a value for the base weight of a pokemon species. In this tutorial we won't cover variable weights per pokemon, we will only use the base weight of the species. 
        
        <pre .language-cs><code>
// SeralizeFields
[Header("Sizes")]
[SerializeField] float baseWeight;

// Getters
public float BaseWeight { get { return baseWeight; } set { baseWeight = value; } }
        </code></pre>

      <hr />
      <h2 id="MoveBase">MoveBase.cs</h2>
      <p>
        Next we are gonna update the MoveBase to change the use of power based on weight. Since there are multiple option to decide the power of a Move I decided to add a new enum for this called PowerBasedOn
        After adding the enum to the other Move enums, we add a new getter and setter.

        <pre .language-cs><code>
...
// Below MoveBase class, together with the other Enums 
public enum PowerBasedOn
{
    value, targetWeight, weightDifference
}

...
          
// Inside MoveBase
// Setter
[SerializeField] PowerBasedOn powerBasedOn = PowerBasedOn.value;

// Getter
public PowerBasedOn PowerBasedOn => powerBasedOn;
        </code></pre>
<hr />
      <h2 id="Pokemon">Pokemon.cs</h2>
      <p>
        Lastly we need to add the ranges and update the calculation. We first start with adding 2 new Methods: GetPowerFromBaseWeight() and GetPowerFromWeightDifference(Pokemon source). After that we update the Power that's being using inside the TakeDamge method.

        <pre .language-cs><code>
// Base Power
int p = move.Base.Power;
if (move.Base.PowerBasedOn == PowerBasedOn.targetWeight)
  p = GetPowerFromBaseWeight();
else if (move.Base.PowerBasedOn == PowerBasedOn.weightDifference)
  p = GetPowerFromWeightDifference(attacker);

...
          
// Methods
public int GetPowerFromBaseWeight()
{
  float w = _base.BaseWeight;
  if (w < 10f) { return 20; } 
  else if (w < 25f) { return 40; }
  else if (w < 50f) { return 60; }
  else if (w < 100f) { return 80; }
  else if (w < 200f) { return 100; } 
  else { return 120; }
}

public int GetPowerFromWeightDifference(Pokemon source)
{
  float defending = _base.BaseWeight;
  float attacking = source._base.BaseWeight;

  if (defending > (attacking * 0.5f))
    return 40;
  else if (defending > (attacking * 0.3335f)) 
    return 60;
  else if (defending > (attacking * 0.2501f))
    return 80;
  else if (defending > (attacking * 0.2001f))
    return 100;
  else
    return 120;
}
        </code></pre>
      </p>

        Now everything is in place we can start making the move. The move I will be creating as an example will be Low Kick and Heavy Slam which both use a different calculation. I will be using the move data from Gen 9: Scarlet/Violet <br /><br />
